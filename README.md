## Cloning

2. Navigate into `Ecommerce-Project`

## Push Your Changes

GitHub is built on the [push/pull architecture](https://medium.com/@_JeffPoole/thoughts-on-push-vs-pull-architectures-666f1eab20c2), which means that multiple places are able to have varying versions of a given project, at any given moment.
This repository is the `main` repository (or branch as we call it), as is default with all GitHub repositories.

To push your changes, I recommend that you use GitHub Desktop or manually make a pull request.

**Note:** Do not worry about making new branches for staging a change. Just commit everything to `main`, if it does not let you then let me know because I barely know how permissions work on repositories lol.
